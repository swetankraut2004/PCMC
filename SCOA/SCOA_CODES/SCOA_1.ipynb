    "## Title: Implementation of Mathematical Operations on Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Relations with Max–Min Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Fuzzy set theory extends classical set theory by allowing elements to have degrees of membership in [0, 1] rather than a crisp 0/1 belonging. This notebook implements basic fuzzy set operations (union, intersection, complement), constructs fuzzy relations via the Cartesian product, and computes the max–min composition of relations. These ideas are useful in decision systems, control, and AI when uncertainty or vagueness is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical operations on fuzzy sets\n",
    "Let A and B be fuzzy sets on a common universe X. For each x ∈ X the membership functions are denoted μ_A(x) and μ_B(x). The basic operations used in this assignment are the Zadeh definitions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Union:  μ_{A∪B}(x) = max( μ_A(x), μ_B(x) )\n",
    "- Intersection:  μ_{A∩B}(x) = min( μ_A(x), μ_B(x) )\n",
    "- Complement:  μ_{A'}(x) = 1 − μ_A(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are exactly the formulas implemented in the code cell above: each operation maps every element x to a value in [0,1] computed from A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fuzzy relations and Cartesian product\n",
    "A fuzzy relation R between sets A (on X) and B (on Y) is built from the Cartesian product: for every (x,y) ∈ X×Y\n",
    "\n",
    "R(x,y) = min( μ_A(x), μ_B(y) )\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces a matrix-like structure whose (x,y) entry measures the degree of association between x and y. The notebook stores this as a dictionary mapping the tuple (x,y) to its membership grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Max–Min composition of fuzzy relations\n",
    "Given R1 : X×Y → [0,1] and R2 : Y×Z → [0,1], their max–min composition R = R1 ∘ R2 is defined for each (x,z) by\n",
    "\n",
    "R(x,z) = max_{y ∈ Y} min( R1(x,y), R2(y,z) )\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition: for each intermediate y compute the strength of the path x → y → z as the weaker link min(R1(x,y), R2(y,z)). Then take the strongest of those indirect paths (the max over y).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "- Intersection: μ_{A∩B} = { (1, 0.2), (2, 0.4), (3, 0.9) } (elementwise min)\n",
    "- Complement of A: { (1, 0.8), (2, 0.3), (3, 0.0) } (1 − μ_A)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cartesian product R = A × B (rows indexed by A, columns by B):\n",
    "R = [ [min(0.2,0.5), min(0.2,0.4), min(0.2,0.9)],\n",
    "      [min(0.7,0.5), min(0.7,0.4), min(0.7,0.9)],\n",

    "### How this aligns to the notebook code (cell 1) — line-by-line mapping\n",
    "Below is a concise mapping between the code you have in the first cell and the mathematical operations above. This explains what each block of code does and the formula it implements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import numpy as np` — imports NumPy (alias `np`). In the current notebook this import is unused; it can be removed or used later for vectorized implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `X = [1,2,3,4,5]` — defines the universe X. Mathematically X = {1,2,3,4,5}.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `A = {1:0.2, ...}` and `B = {...}` — represent fuzzy sets as Python dictionaries: x ↦ μ_A(x).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `def union(A,B): return {x: max(A[x],B[x]) for x in A}` — implements μ_{A∪B}(x) = max(μ_A(x), μ_B(x)). Note: it iterates keys of `A`; to be robust iterate over set(A)|set(B) and use `.get(x,0)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `def intersection(A,B): ...` — implements μ_{A∩B}(x) = min(μ_A(x), μ_B(x)).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `def complement(A): return {x: 1-A[x] for x in A}` — computes μ_{A'}(x) = 1 − μ_A(x).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `def cartesian(A,B): return {(x,y): min(A[x],B[y]) for x in A for y in B}` — builds the fuzzy relation R(x,y) = min( μ_A(x), μ_B(y) ).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `def max_min_composition(R1,R2,A_set,B_set,C_set):` — computes (R1 ∘ R2)(x,z) = max_y min(R1(x,y), R2(y,z)) by explicitly iterating x, z and all y in B_set. For finite sets the sup becomes a max.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `print` statements — display the dictionaries and relation entries; the relations are stored as dictionary keys (x,y) → membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation notes, edge cases and small improvements\n",
    "- Key assumptions: the code indexes dictionaries directly (e.g., `A[x]`) so A and B must contain the same domain keys, and R1/R2 must contain all required pair keys. Missing keys cause KeyError.\n",
    "- Robustness: iterate keys = set(A) | set(B) and use `A.get(x,0)` / `R.get((x,y),0)` to treat missing entries as 0 (no membership).\n",
    "- Complexity: union/intersection/complement are O(|X|); cartesian is O(|A|·|B|); max–min composition is O(|A|·|B|·|C|). For larger universes consider vectorized NumPy arrays or sparse representations.\n",
    "- Minor optimization: in `max_min_composition` you can avoid building an intermediate list by using a generator expression: `max(min(R1[(x,y)], R2[(y,z)]) for y in B_set)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world applications\n",
    "Fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations are widely used in practical systems where uncertainty, vagueness, or human-like reasoning is required. Typical applications include:\n",
    "- Control systems: fuzzy controllers (e.g., household appliances like washing machines, air conditioners, microwave ovens) implement rules such as ‘IF temperature is high THEN reduce heating’ using fuzzy membership and rule aggregation.\n",
    "- Decision support and expert systems: combine qualitative rules from experts (medical diagnosis, credit scoring, loan approval).\n",
    "- Pattern recognition and image processing: fuzzy clustering, edge detection, and filtering where pixel membership degrees represent uncertainty.\n",
    "- Robotics and autonomous systems: sensor fusion, path planning with uncertain inputs, and behavior arbitration using fuzzy relations.\n",
    "- Natural language processing and human interfaces: mapping words like ‘hot’, ‘likely’, or ‘near’ to membership functions to enable interpretable rule-based decisions.\n",
    "- Risk assessment and finance: modeling vague or imprecise criteria for portfolio selection, credit risk, or insurance underwriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Handles vagueness and partial truth naturally — membership values in [0,1] let you express degrees rather than binary yes/no.\n",
    "- Intuitive rule-based modeling — domain experts can express knowledge as linguistic rules that map directly to fuzzy rules.\n",
    "- Robustness to noisy or imprecise inputs — fuzzy aggregation smooths small variations.\n",
    "- Flexible: compatible with heuristics, and can be combined with probabilistic or learning methods.\n",
    "- Fast prototyping: simple dictionary/array implementations work well for small-to-medium sized problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages and limitations\n",
    "- Subjectivity: choice of membership functions and linguistic labels is often ad-hoc and depends on expert judgment.\n",
    "- Rule explosion: with many inputs and linguistic labels the number of rules can grow combinatorially.\n",
    "- Lack of probabilistic semantics: fuzzy membership is not probability; mixing probabilistic uncertainty with fuzzy vagueness requires careful modeling.\n",
    "- Parameter tuning: shapes and parameters of membership functions often need manual tuning or optimization.\n",
    "- Computational cost: naive relation compositions scale cubically for large universes (|A|·|B|·|C|) — need sparse or approximate methods for large problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical tips and suggestions\n",
    "- Start with small, interpretable membership functions (triangular or trapezoidal) and validate with domain experts.\n",
    "- Use robust defaults (treat missing membership keys as 0) and make functions tolerant: `A.get(x,0)`.\n",
    "- For larger problems use sparse representations, vectorized arrays (NumPy), or libraries such as `scikit-fuzzy` to speed up computations.\n",
    "- Combine fuzzy logic with probabilistic methods when both randomness and vagueness exist (e.g., Bayesian fuzzy models, fuzzy random variables).\n",
    "- Provide unit tests for the canonical identities (e.g., complement, De Morgan-like properties under chosen t-norms/t-conorms) on small examples.\n",

If you want, I can now: (a) add a short code cell that prints a formatted example matrix, (b) refactor the functions to be robust to missing keys, or (c) add unit tests that validate the formulas on the example sets."

    "* `X` is the *universe of discourse* (the domain) — here the finite set `{1,2,3,4,5}`.\n",
    "* `A` and `B` are fuzzy sets represented as Python dictionaries mapping each element of `X` to its membership degree in the set (numbers between 0 and 1).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mathematical note:** With `R1 = A×B` and `R2 = B×A`, the composition is a relation from `A` to `A` (since both ends are `X` here). In fuzzy relation algebra this is analogous to computing `R = A × B` then `R ∘ R^T` (if `R2` were `R1` transposed). In your code `R2` is `B×A` (which is effectively transpose of `R1` if you map indices accordingly).\n",

    "## Suggestions / Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use full universe union for set ops**: change comprehensions to `for x in sorted(set(A)|set(B))` so missing keys in either set are handled.\n",
    "2. **Type / value safety**: check membership values are in `[0,1]`, and add guards for missing `(x,y)` keys or empty intermediate sets.\n",
    "3. **Performance**: if sets get large, consider `numpy` arrays or sparse representations to speed-up heavy composition loops.\n",
    "4. **Readability**: add docstrings for each function describing expected input shapes (keys) and return type.\n",
    "5. **Generality**: make `cartesian` accept a t-norm function parameter (e.g., `min` or product) to allow other fuzzy t-norms.\n",
